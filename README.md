## What is Hactoberfest?

**Hacktoberfest**, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by Digital Ocean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects.

### How Does it Work?

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
1. Maintainers determine if their open-source projects participate by adding the â€˜hacktoberfestâ€™ label.
2. Quality pull requests submitted on GitHub and GitLab are rewarded
3. Engaged maintenance of Hacktoberfest tagged repositories are rewarded.

Primarily speaking of which , the Hacktoberfest Pull requests will be accpeted only if the Github or Gitlab is logged in via Hacktoberfest Official website

### Rules

1. Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/projects. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a project is participating in Hacktoberfest.
2. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.
3. The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
4. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
5. If a maintainer reports behavior thatâ€™s not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
6. A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label.

## Important Terminology
Let's see some terms that we'll use in this competition. I know that this is so much, no need to remember this stuff just have a glance. Infact there are alot of termm that I haven't included yet.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
- **@mention:** To notify a person on GitHub by using @ before their username. Users in an organization on GitHub can also be a part of a team that can be mentioned.
-  **base branch:** The branch into which changes are combined when you merge a pull request. When you create a pull request, you can change the base branch from the repository's default branch to another branch if required.
-  **Branch:** This is an important term to remember. A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes.
-  **clone:** A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. When you make a clone, you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. The repository you cloned is still connected to the remote version so that you can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.
-  **collaborator:** A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.
-  **commit:** A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.
-  **fork:** A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.
-  **Git:** Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.
-  **maintainer:** A maintainer is a person who has access to all PR's made by other coders, who has delivered the knowledge of existing issue in a project to the repository owner. They can take the PR into the consideration to solve the issues or bugs present in the project.
-  **merge:** Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.
-  **pull request:** Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.
-  **README:** A text file containing information about the files in a repository that is typically the first file a visitor to your repository will see. A README file, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, helps you share expectations and manage contributions to your project.
-  **repository:** A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
